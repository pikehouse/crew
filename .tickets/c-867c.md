# Add queue command to show scheduling pipeline

Add cmd_queue() that shows full tk dependency pipeline. Call tk query for JSON, build dependency graph, topological sort into waves. Display: Ready now, Next (grouped by what unblocks them), Later (with deps shown), Blocked. Register as 'queue' with alias 'q'.
