# Show agent assignments in ready command output

The 'ready' command shows tickets from tk ready, but doesn't indicate which ones already have agents working on them. Add markers like: 'c-1234 [a] - Title' for assigned, or show a separate section for 'In Progress' vs 'Available'. Helps user understand why idle agents aren't picking up seemingly ready tickets.
