# Session recovery must complete done agents, not just mark them

Bug: When recovery detects DONE in agent logs, it marks status='done' but never calls complete_task(). This leaves agents in limbo: their tickets stay open, work isn't merged, agents don't return to idle. Result: tickets show as 'ready' but are still assigned to done agents, blocking other idle agents from taking them. Fix: Recovery should call complete_task() for any agent it marks as done, which will merge work, close ticket via tk close, and return agent to idle.
