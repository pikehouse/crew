# Add session recovery on startup

On launch, detect prior session state from .crew/state.json. Display resume message showing agents and their status. Validate worktrees exist on disk. For orphaned worktrees in agents/, warn user. If worktree missing but agent expects it, reset agent to idle. Reconcile working agents that were mid-step when process died.
