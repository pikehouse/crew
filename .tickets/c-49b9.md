# Recovery should reset dirty agents to idle, not try to recover partial work

Simpler recovery approach: If agent has uncommitted changes in worktree on startup, don't try to figure out what happened. Just remove the worktree and reset agent to idle. The ticket stays open and can be re-assigned. Only call complete_task() if worktree is CLEAN and has committed work. This avoids complexity of trying to recover partial/inconsistent states.
