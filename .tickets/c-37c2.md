# Fix log panel showing stale logs from previous tasks

Bug: Dashboard log panels show logs from previous tasks, not the current one. Root cause: Logs are stored per-agent (.crew/logs/<agent>/001-step.log) and read_latest_log() returns the highest-numbered file, which may be from a prior task. Fix options: 1) Clear logs when new task is assigned, 2) Include task ID in log filename, 3) Track starting log number per task assignment. This causes confusing display where agent shows 'working' with step=0 but logs show 'DONE' from old task.
