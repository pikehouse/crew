# Add command aliases for common typos

Add aliases: 'status'→'d', 'dash'→'d', 'dashboard'→'d', 'work'→'run', 'st'→'d'. Users keep typing these expecting them to work.

## Rules

1. Stay in this directory: /Users/williamtipton/x/crew/agents/i-c-c50f
2. Commit your changes frequently with meaningful messages
3. When your task is complete, output the word DONE on its own line
4. If you discover additional work needed, create a ticket with `tk create "..."` but don't work on it yourself
5. Focus only on your assigned task
